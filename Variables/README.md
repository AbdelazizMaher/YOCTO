WORKDIR
--------------

The location of the work directory in which the`OpenEmbedded` build system builds a recipe.

> this directory is located within the `TMPDIR` directory structure and is specific to the recipe being built and the system for which it is being built.

The `WORKDIR directory` is defined as follows:

```bash
${TMPDIR}/work/${MULTIMACH_TARGET_SYS}/${PN}/${EXTENDPE}${PV}-${PR}
```

**`TMPDIR`**: The top-level build output directory

**`MULTIMACH_TARGET_SYS`**: The target system identifier

**`PN`**: The recipe name

**`EXTENDPE`**: Mostly blank

**`PV`**: The recipe version
